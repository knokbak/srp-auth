# srp-auth

#### A JavaScript implementation of the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.

SRP is a protocol which allows a server to authenticate a client without transmitting the client's password in plain text. SRP is an implementation of password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE). SRP (as a protocol) is used by services such as ProtonMail and AWS Cognito.

# API

## class ClientSetup(config: ClientSetupConfig)
- `config.username` (string) :: The username used for authentication.
- `config.password` (string) :: The plain text password. There is no need to hash this beforehand!
- `config.salt`? (Uint8Array) :: The salt to use. If undefined, one will be securely generated.
- `config.saltLength`? (number) :: The amount of bits to be used in the generated salt. Defaults to `192` bits. Ignored when `config.salt` is provided.
- `group`: (Group) :: The SRP group to use. The built-in groups are from [RFC 5054](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5054#appendix-A).
- `algorithm` (Algorithm) :: The hashing algorithm to use.

### await init(): Promise\<ClientSetupResult\>
Computes `v` and `s`, to be used by the server. You can send `encoded.v` and `encoded.s` to the server, along with `I`.

**Returns:** ClientSetupResult
- `I` (string) :: The username in plain text. This should be sent to the server, **not the original username provided to the library**!
- `raw.v` (Uint8Array) :: The verifier (`v`) as a Uint8Array.
- `raw.s` (Uint8Array) :: The salt generated by the client (`s`) as a Uint8Array.
- `encoded.v` (string) :: The verifier (`v`) encoded as hex.
- `encoded.s` (string) :: The salt generated by the client (`s`) encoded as hex.

## class ClientAuthenticate(config: ClientAuthenticateConfig)
- `username` (string) :: The username in plain text.
- `password` (string) :: The password in plain text.
- `group` (Group) :: The SRP group to use. The built-in groups are from [RFC 5054](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5054#appendix-A).
- `algorithm` (Algorithm) :: The hashing algorithm to use.

### await init(): Promise\<ClientAuthenticateInit\>
Computes `A`, the client's ephemeral session key. This should be sent to the server, along with `I`.

**Returns:** ClientAuthenticateInit
- `I` (string) :: The username in plain text. This should be sent to the server, **not the original username provided to the library**!
- `raw.A` (Uint8Array) :: The client's ephemeral session key (`A`) as a Uint8Array.
- `encoded.A` (string) :: The client's ephemeral session key (`A`) encoded as hex.

### await exchange(B: string | Uint8Array, s: string | Uint8Array): Promise\<void\>
Computes `u` (a combination of both the client and server's ephemeral session keys `A` and `B`), `S` (the session key) and `K` (the client's key).

- `B` (string | Uint8Array) :: The server's ephemeral session key (`B`), which should be provided by the server. If a string is provided, it must be hex encoded.
- `s` (string | Uint8Array) :: The salt (`s`) which was originally calculated by the client but is now stored by the server. If a string is provided, it must be hex encoded.

**Returns:** *void*

### await authenticate(): Promise\<ClientAuthenticateResult\>
Computes `M1` which can be used by the server to verify the client's authenticity, without sending the user's password in plain text.

**Returns:** ClientAuthenticateResult
- `raw.M1` (Uint8Array) :: The client's authentication key (`M1`), derived from `N`, `g`, `s`, `A`, `B`, `I` and `K`, as a Uint8Array.
- `encoded.M1` (string) :: The client's authentication key (`M1`) encoded as hex.

### await verifyServer(M2: string | Uint8Array): Promise\<void\>
Verifies that the server holds the verifier (`v`) that was originally created by the client during setup. This authenticates the server.

- `M2` (string | Uint8Array) :: The server's authentication key (`M2`), which should be provided by the server. If a string is provided, it must be hex encoded.

> ⚠️ `verifyServer(...)` will throw an `SRPError` if M2 does not match its expected value. If an error is thrown, the client may still have passed authentication, but the server **cannot** be trusted. You may be caught in the middle of a MitM attack!

**Returns:** *void*

# Behind the scenes

`H(...)` = A hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256.   
`I` = The user's 'identity' (username)   
`p` = The plain text password   
`x` = A token calculated by the client   
`v` = The verifier   

✓ = Handled by this library.   
~ = Handled by the user of the library.   

## Setup

### 1. Client

✓ Generates a random salt (`s`).   
✓ Calculates `id = H(I + ':' + p)`.   
✓ Calculates `x = H(s + id)`.   
✓ Calculates `v = g ^ x % N`.   
~ Sends `I`, `s` and `v` to the server.   

> ⚠️ **`x` is private** and should never be stored or transmitted by the client. This includes to the server. Anyone with `x` can derive the plain text password.   

### 2. Server

~ Receives `I`, `s` and `v` from the client. `I` should be stored as the user's username, and `s` and `v` should be stored to verify the user's password in the future.   

## Authentication

### 1. Client

✓ Generates a random value (`a`).   
✓ Calculates `A = g ^ a`.   
~ Sends `I` and `A` to the server.
